            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><span>M</span>onhandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the small town of Porbandar, on the west coast of India, on October 2 1869. He belonged by birth to the Vaishya, or trading caste. His father died when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother became the greatest influence in his life. Her spiritual teacher was a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central doctrine is the "sanctity of all life," or Ahimsa, which is often translated as "non-violence." This teaching remained paramount with Gandhi.</p>

                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Mahatma Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, which was then part of the British Empire. Although young Gandhi wanted to become a doctor, his father, who served as a chief minister in Porbandar, persuaded him to study law. His father died when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother became the greatest influence in his life. After 3 years of studies in London (where he became a vegetarian), Gandhi came back to India and tried to start his career as a lawyer.</p>

                        <h4>In South Africa</h4>
                        <p>After struggling to find a job in India, he went to South Africa for a one-year contract to perform legal services. Gandhi was there confronted with discrimination against Indian immigrants by British authorities. At the end of his contract, Gandhi fought against a bill that would ban Indians from voting. Although he didn't stop the bill from passing, it initiated his fight for equality of human rights.

                        <h4>India’s Independence</h4>
                        <p>After a series of protests, India's independence was inevitable. The Government of India Act (1935) surrendered significant amounts of power to Indians, and the Indian National Congress clamoured for more. But after World War II Muslim League demanded that a separate state be created for India's Muslims, and to Gandhi's great distress, the Congress leaders agreed. In August 1947, India was finally independent, not as a whole but divided into two countries, India and Pakistan.</p>

                        <h4>Assasination</h4>
                        <p>Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu nationalist, Nathuram Godse, in Delhi on January 30, 1948. Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacency towards Muslims, holding him responsible for the frenzy of violence and suffering. Gandhi's death was mourned nationwide, and over a million people joined the five-mile-long funeral procession that took over five hours.</p>

                                            in automobiles, Tesla decided to develop his own turbine-style engine.
                                            Also known as the boundary-layer turbine and cohesion-type turbine,
                                            Tesla’s turbine was distinct in its design. Unlike conventional turbines
                                            Tesla’s design was bladeless, instead employing smooth discs rotating in

                                            50 miles, from his lab at 33 and 35 South Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, to

                                            was his influence on the development of alternating current (AC).
                                            Perhaps it shouldn’t, strictly speaking, feature in a list of his
                                            inventions, but there’s no doubt that his technology was instrumental in
                                            the emergence of AC as the world’s dominant electrical system. </p>

                                            realised a long-held hope that the awesome force of Niagara Falls, one

                                            curtailed by the fire that destroyed his New York lab in 1895 relates to
                                            the emergence of X-ray technology. Famously, German scientist Wilhelm
                                            Conrad Röntgen developed the first X-ray on the 8 November of that same
